|**Use Case**     |**Scenario**                                                                                                                                     |**Swimm Features**                                                                                                                        |

|**Complex Code** |The code is very complex, and only a few people in the company really understand it                                                              |Create a **Walkthrough** document with **live** **code snippets** and **code references**.                                                |
|**Refactoring.** |Refactoring a project - touching many files in a short period of time, which causes existing documentation to **break** and become **inaccurate**|With Swimm's **Auto-sync** you will be notified - decide whether to **fix changes** manually or with **Automatic approval** üå±            |
|**Microservices**|Interacts with **multiple services** over **multiple repositories** - makes the knowledge complex and hard to follow                             |Use **Cross-Repo docs**. Describe each input and output between repos and how they interact. Use **playlists** to create flows of the code|
|**Onboarding**   |A new developer joined the team. The new dev needs to **set up** their environment and proper **onboarding** program                             |With **Playlists**, you can create an **individual onboarding program** to group all the documents under any topic.                       |
