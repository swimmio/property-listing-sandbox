::: TIP
Try it! **Use slash commands**
Swimm provides a wide range of spacial commands for amazing docs

<br/>

And now the same thing using our Slash Commands..

Dev docs can’t be completed without some code references




## Where it gets interesting... 👻 

<br/>

<!--BANNER-->
::: TIP
Try it! **Add a live code snippet from our Sandbox project**
:::

<br/>

Codeblocks are nice for syntax highlighting.  
The problem 😩 is that when the real code changes, the codeblocks may become obsulete.  
Let’s try something else...

You were asked to:

*   Choose a file
    
*   Select a section from the code
    
*   Hit enter
    

Your Code snippet should look something like this (below is just an image)
